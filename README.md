## 🔗 RSGCore Integration
> [!TIP]
> This version includes enhanced RSGCore integration for seamless migration from rsg-inventory.

This version includes:
- Automatic item synchronization from RSGCore shared data
- Bridge functions for seamless transition from rsg-inventory
- Maintained export structure for existing scripts

## ⚠️ Migration from rsg-inventory
> [!WARNING]
> Before migrating from rsg-inventory, ensure you backup your database and test thoroughly in a development environment before moving forward.

### Migration Steps:
1. Stop your server
2. Backup your database (DONT REALLY WORRY AS OX_INV HAS ITS OWN TABLE, BUT GOOD PRACTICE! )
3. Remove rsg-inventory from server.cfg / stop it
4. Add ox_inventory to server.cfg
5. Test thoroughly before going live

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
> [!CAUTION]
> If you encounter issues with item synchronization, verify that RSGCore is up to date & is also running before ox_inventory in your server.cfg.

### Common Issues:
- **Items not loading**: Check RSGCore shared items configuration
- **Money not displaying**: Ensure money items are properly configured in RSGCore / enabled
- **Cant Interact with drops**: Verify RSGCore is started before the inventory / ox lib
- **UI Bugs**: Ensure in index.html the **JS/CSS** names are right / build it again
